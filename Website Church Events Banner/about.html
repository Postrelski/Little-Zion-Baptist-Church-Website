      <h3>Declaration of Faith</h3>

      <p class="about-text">
        We are a family of believers in Jesus Christ, called to show forth the
        joy of living a Christ centered life. We accomplish this through our
        freedom in worship and our structured doctrinal discipline that empowers
        us to reflect the character and nature of Christ in the earth. We are to
        live as beacons of light in dark places. We are a sanctuary of relief
        and a refuge of hope. Our purpose is to refresh the weary and heal the
        broken through providing a genuine authentic encounter with the Christ.
      </p>
      <p class="about-text">
        Love is of God. We will love God as He loves us and love others as He
        loves them. We will pursue excellence in all we do, as God is excellent
        in all He does. We will accept others as they are because God has
        accepted us as we are. We will be just in our actions toward others
        because God delights in the just. We will show grace to others because
        God has shown us His amazing grace. We will be generous to others
        because we owe it to God and to them, and we will be faithful to God and
        His people because God remembers, and enjoys the faithful.

        <p>
          Our ministry is committed to serving in God’s excellence with
          integrity and compassion for our community, our nation, and our world.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are striving to become an oasis of hope within the community by
          promoting and providing education, awareness, as well as financial
          independence.
        </p>
        <p>
          We strive to challenge and build up spiritual and community leaders
          through mentoring and the pursuit of spiritual and academic
          excellence.
        </p>
        <p>
          We seek to reach the lost and the broken and serve them with the
          upmost dignity and respect. Our environment is a loving and inviting
          atmosphere that inspires you to worship; we believe that God must be
          worshipped in spirit and truth.
        </p>
        <p>
          We embrace freedom in worship because the Word says, “Where the spirit
          of the Lord is, there is liberty.”
        </p>
        <p>
          We are a ministry founded on the true, unfailing, everlasting Word of
          God; we believe God’s Word in its entirety believing we can do what it
          says we can do, be who it says we can be, and have what it says we can
          have.

          by sharing the gospel to the lost and broken.
        </p>
        <p>
          We Exalt God’s greatness by assembling together in worship and
          embracing the freedom of worshipping the true and living God.
        </p>
        <p>
          We seek to Equip God’s people by building them up through the Word of
          God and sharing the message of hope, salvation, and the promises of
          God once they are in Christ Jesus.
